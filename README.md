# Simon_game
The classic "Simon" board game.

The goal is to remember the sequence of random button generated every turn by the software and press the buttons in the right order.

HOW TO PLAY

1) Press any key to start. The game then will generate animation and sound on the button to press.
2) Press the button.
3) Congrats, you reached level 1!
4) Now the game will generate another animation and sound on the next button of the game pattern. That's the last button of the sequence to press! The goal is to remember each previous button in the right sequence to pass the level.
5) Press the buttons in the right order.
6) Congrats, you reached level 2!
7) REPEAT!  

P.S. 

My record is 13, try to beat me!
